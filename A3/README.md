# Experiment 3: Email Spam or Ham Classification using Na¨ıve Bayes, KNN, and SVM

## Aim
 To classify emails as spam or ham using three classification algorithms—Na¨ıve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—and evaluate their performance using
 accuracy metrics and K-Fold cross-validation.
